# Deep Research: Recent Advances in Language Models

## 1. **Scaling Language Models: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Training Gopher**

Hoffmann et al. (2022)

This paper presents Gopher, a 280 billion parameter language model developed by DeepMind. The authors provide extensive analysis of the model's capabilities across 152 diverse tasks.

- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446
- Key findings: Model scale significantly improves performance on knowledge-intensive tasks

## 2. **Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models**

Hoffmann, Borgeaud, Mensch et al. (2022)

Known as the "Chinchilla" paper, this work challenges previous scaling laws and demonstrates that many large language models are significantly undertrained.

## 3. **Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4**

Bubeck, Chandrasekaran, Eldan et al. (2023)

Microsoft Research's comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's capabilities, arguing that it shows early signs of artificial general intelligence.

## 5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks**

Lewis, Perez, Piktus et al. (2020)

Introduces RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), combining pre-trained language models with retrieval mechanisms for improved knowledge-intensive task performance.

DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2005.11401
